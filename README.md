# GTSRB Dataset Spatial Transformer Network Implementation on PyTorch

Personal Experiments on Implementing a Spatial Transformer Network for identification of German traffic signs. Dataset used is the [German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign) consisting of 43 different traffic sign types and 50000+ images. Experiments we're performed on Jupyter Notebook for ease of experimentation and visualization of results in real time.
